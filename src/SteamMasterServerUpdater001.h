	// These are in GameSocketShare mode, where instead of ISteamMasterServerUpdater creating its own
	// socket to talk to the master server on, it lets the game use its socket to forward messages
	// back and forth. This prevents us from requiring server ops to open up yet another port
	// in their firewalls.
	//
	// the IP address and port should be in host order, i.e 127.0.0.1 == 0x7f000001

	// These are used when you've elected to multiplex the game server's UDP socket
	// rather than having the master server updater use its own sockets.
	// 
	// Source games use this to simplify the job of the server admins, so they 
	// don't have to open up more ports on their firewalls.
